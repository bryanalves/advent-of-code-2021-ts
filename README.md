Solutions in "Typescript"

I wanted to see what using Typescript was like compared to normal javascript, so I did these exercises.  I got started late and rushed to catch up, so I didn't get as much of a chance to explore as much of Typescript as I wanted.  I really wanted to use strict mode, but left a lot of "any" around to make things compile and work so I could catch up.  I may come back and clean this up, or at least run through a linter, but thiscode is pretty garbage for now.
